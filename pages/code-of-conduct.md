## Code of Conduct: House of Adventures (Kolkata TTRPG Community)
Weâ€™re a hybrid tabletop RPG communityâ€”half online, half offline. Whether youâ€™re rolling dice in person or joining us from your screen, this code ensures everyone feels welcome, respected, and safe.

<br>
### GENERAL GUIDELINES (For Everyone)
1. **Respect First:** Treat all players, Dungeon Masters (DMs), volunteers, and organizers with respect and courtesyâ€”online and in-person.
2. **Inclusive Space:** Everyone is welcomeâ€”regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, neurodiversity, disability, or background.
3. **Zero Tolerance for Hate:** No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or religious discriminationâ€”period.
4. **Keep It Clean:** No offensive or inappropriate language, jokes, gestures, memes, usernames, or profile pictures.
5. **Report Harassment:** If you feel unsafe or witness inappropriate behavior, contact a moderator or organizer immediately.

<br>
### ONLINE-SPECIFIC RULES
1. **Be Present & On Time:** Join games on time. Repeated ghosting or no-shows = bans from future online sessions.
2. **Respect the Channel:** No mic spamming, talking over others, or hijacking chats.
3. **Camera Etiquette:** Keep your camera on when required by the DM (unless pre-agreed otherwise).
4. **DM's Word Is Final:** Donâ€™t argue with the DMâ€™s rulings in VC or chat. Save it for post-session feedback.
5. **No Recording Without Consent:** Ask before streaming, recording, or sharing screenshots of sessions.
 
<br>
### IN-PERSON-SPECIFIC RULES
1. **Arrival Time:** Report by 1 PM. Games start at 2 PM sharp. No late entries.
2. **Donâ€™t Interrupt Games:** Spectators must not distract players during sessions.
3. **Venue Liability:** Bring belongings at your own risk. Organizers and venues are not liable for lost or stolen items.
4. **Respect Property:** Damaging venue or personal property = immediate disciplinary action.
5. **Ask Before Touching:** Donâ€™t use or move othersâ€™ dice, minis, or notebooks without permission.

<br>
### GAMEPLAY RULES (Applies Everywhere)
1. **Respect the DM and Players:** Donâ€™t interrupt the DM mid-description. Donâ€™t metagame or derail play.
2. **Collaborative Spirit:** Donâ€™t hog the spotlight. Everyone gets their moment.
3. **Disruptive Behavior = Out:** Repeated drama, rules-lawyering, or aggressive behavior leads to bans.

<br>
### ENFORCEMENT
- Violations are handled on a case-by-case basis.
- Minor issues = warning. Major issues = removal or permanent ban.
- We reserve the right to refuse participation to anyone who threatens the safety or integrity of the community.
