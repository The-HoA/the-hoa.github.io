## Frequently Asked Questions


### What is a TTRPG?
A TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) is a collaborative storytelling game where players assume the roles of characters and navigate adventures guided by a Game Master (GM). Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is one of the most well-known TTRPGs.

### Do I need any experience to join?
Not at all! We welcome complete beginners, curious newcomers, and seasoned adventurers alike. Our sessions are beginner-friendly, and our GMs are happy to walk you through the basics.

### How do I sign up for a game night or event?
We announce upcoming events and games on our official Discord and WhatsApp groups. IRL events will have a sign-up form or instructions on how to join.

### Do I need to bring anything?
For in-person events:
<ul style="padding-left: 2rem;">
<li style="padding-left: 0.5rem;"> We provide character tokens, maps, dice, and all necessary materials. </li>
<li style="padding-left: 0.5rem;"> You're welcome to bring your own dice, miniatures, or props if you like! </li>
</ul>
<br/>
For online sessions:
<ul style="padding-left: 2rem;">
<li style="padding-left: 0.5rem;"> You may need access to platforms like Discord, Roll20, or D&D Beyond (we'll let you know ahead of time).</li>
<li style="padding-left: 0.5rem;"> A stable internet connection and a mic are recommended.</li>
</ul>

### Is there a fee to participate?
Some events are free; others may have a small entry fee to cover venue, materials, or GM time. Details are always mentioned in the event post.

### What if I've never created a character before?
No problem! We offer pre-generated characters, character creation workshops run by experienced GMs, and we're happy to help you build your own before the session. Our in-person events always have a mandatory session 0 where the GM will personally assist you.

### How long does a session last?
A typical one-shot or intro session lasts 3–4 hours. Longer campaigns may vary in duration and are discussed ahead of time.

### Can I come just to watch?
Absolutely! Spectators are welcome at most events (space permitting), and it's a great way to learn how the game works before jumping in.

### What kind of games do you run besides D&D?
While Dungeons & Dragons is our most popular system, we also explore a variety of TTRPGs like Call of Cthulhu, Pathfinder, Mork Borg, Monster of the Week, Candela Obscura, and more, depending on interest and availability.

### Can I GM a session with House of Adventures?
Yes! We're always excited to collaborate with passionate Game Masters. If you'd like to run a game at one of our events or online, reach out through our contact form or Discord.

### Where are your in-person events held?
We host most of our in-person sessions in Kolkata. Venue details are shared ahead of each event. We occasionally partner with local cafés, anime conventions, and hobby spaces.
