      <h2>WHO ARE WE</h2>
      <p>What started as a humble Discord server among friends—each fueled by a love for storytelling and inspired by actual play legends like Critical Role—soon became something much bigger. United by curiosity and a shared desire to dive into the world of Dungeons & Dragons, our early sessions were full of learning, laughter, and the kind of chaos only new adventurers can create.</p>
      <p>But the magic didn’t stay contained for long. Word spread, more players joined, and before we knew it, House of Adventures had grown into a thriving community of TTRPG enthusiasts—welcoming veterans, first-timers, and everyone in between.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2023, we took a bold step beyond the virtual tabletop and hosted our very first D&D event in Kolkata. It was more than just a game event—it was the beginning of a dream. And from there? The adventure only grew.</p>
